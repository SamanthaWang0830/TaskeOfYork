# Taste Of York
## The thought and the original code was generated by our hackathon team in 28th Jan
## Right now myself is expanding and updating it so that can be more detailed
### user can have a look at which meals created by her/himself
### user can only delete or update the meal that is created by her/himself
### when the user delete or update one meal, the page automatically rerender
### one user can have several meals, but one meal only belongs to one user
### other users can like or dislike meals
