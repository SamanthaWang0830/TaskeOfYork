# Taste Of York
## The thought and the original code was generated by our hackathon team on 28th Jan
## Right now I am updating and expanding it in a bid to make it become a full stack project (mern)

### *the logic when dealing with meals*
user can have a look at which meals created by themselves.      
user can only delete or update the meal that is created by themselves.      
when the user delete or update one meal, the page automatically rerender.      
one user can have several meals, but one meal only belongs to one user.       
other users can like or dislike meals.    

### *the logic when dealing with users*
users will be automatically loged out after they log in.    
after log out, the page will be automatically redirected to home page.
